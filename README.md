## Project Details
###Idea: Creating interesting visualizations for effective analysis of datasets.
###Intuition:
..*Often arcane relationships exist between datasets
..*Identifying such relationships requires a visual representation
..*Overlaying the effects of datasets enables identification of trends


1. Housing
..*Aggregation of housing prices
..*Further categorization by time periods
2. Military
..*Aggregation by purchase of arms per state
..*Categorization by time periods
3.Death Rates
..*World statistics of death rates summarized

1. Generating a Thematic Map for effective visualization
2. Overlaying the datasets on one other for trend analysis
